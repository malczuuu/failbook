  ## What Happened

  The request could not be processed because it contains invalid or inconsistent data.
  One or more fields failed server-side validation.

  ## Common Causes

  - **Invalid format**: e.g., malformed email, phone, or ID
  - **Out-of-range values**: numbers too small or too large
  - **Missing required fields**
  - **Constraint violations**: uniqueness, length limits, or disallowed values

  ## Example Error

  ```json
  {
    "status": 400,
    "title": "Constraint Violation",
    "errors": [
      { "field": "email", "error": "must be a well-formed email address" },
      { "field": "age", "error": "must be greater than or equal to 18" }
    ]
  }
  ```

  ## What To Do

  1. Verify all required fields are present.
  2. Ensure fields match expected formats (email, UUID, number ranges, etc.).
  3. Check for uniqueness or domain-specific constraints.
  4. Refer to API documentation for field requirements.
